            <h1>🎶 Antsy Records – Sound Beyond Boundaries, Rooted in Seigr</h1>
            <p>
                Tucked between the digital and the organic, <strong>Antsy Records</strong> is more than a label—it’s a 
                <strong>sonic ecosystem</strong>. Fueled by the <strong>Seigr philosophy</strong>, it operates at the 
                crossroads of <strong>modular technology, decentralized creation, and artistic self-sufficiency</strong>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Every release, every note, and every distorted frequency is part of a greater vision: a 
                <strong>self-sustaining, forest-based creative sanctuary</strong> where <strong>sound and nature intertwine</strong>.

            <h2>🌿 The Ethos: Seigr Meets Sound</h2>
            <p>Antsy Records is my personal <strong>sonic publishing house</strong>—a space where music is released <strong>without constraints</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>🎼 <strong>Solo explorations</strong> and <strong>collaborations</strong></li>
                <li>🎵 <strong>Bands, experimental compositions, and modular improvisations</strong></li>
                <li>🔊 <strong>Neo-classical meets noise, metal fuses with improv, horror synth pulses alongside synth pop and avant-garde electronica</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This echoes the spirit of <strong>Abdicate Cell</strong>, the netlabel I founded in 2004, originally a vessel for my own 
                music but later expanding into a home for others. <strong>Antsy</strong> follows a similar path, but 
                <strong>remains deeply committed to fueling my own artistic vision</strong>—and pushing the 
                <strong>Seigr ecosystem forward</strong>.
