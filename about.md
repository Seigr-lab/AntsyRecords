# 🎶 Antsy Records – Sound Beyond Boundaries, Rooted in Seigr  

Tucked between the digital and the organic, **Antsy Records** is more than a label—it’s a **sonic ecosystem**. Fueled by the **Seigr philosophy**, it operates at the crossroads of **modular technology, decentralized creation, and artistic self-sufficiency**. Every release, every note, and every distorted frequency is part of a greater vision: a **self-sustaining, forest-based creative sanctuary** where **sound and nature intertwine**.

## 🌿 The Ethos: Seigr Meets Sound  
Antsy Records is my personal **sonic publishing house**—a space where music is released **without constraints**:  
- **Solo explorations** and **collaborations**  
- **Bands, experimental compositions, and modular improvisations**  
- **Neo-classical meets noise, metal fuses with improv, horror synth pulses alongside synth pop and avant-garde electronica**  

This echoes the spirit of **Abdicate Cell**, the netlabel I founded in 2004, originally a vessel for my own music but later expanding into a home for others. **Antsy** follows a similar path, but **remains deeply committed to fueling my own artistic vision**—and pushing the **Seigr ecosystem forward**.

## 📡 The Releases: Where to Find Antsy  

🔹 **[Bandcamp](https://antsyrecords.bandcamp.com/)** – Raw, direct, and digital.  
🔹 **[Elastic](https://elasticstage.com/antsy) Stage** – On-demand **vinyl pressings**, sound artifacts that take physical form.  
🔹 **Future Physical Editions** – Once Antsy Records and **[Sonisk Seigr](https://www.sonisk.seigr.net)** (my production, recording, and mixing studio) transition to a **forest-based location**, **physical editions** will return—**cassettes, vinyl, and exclusive releases**, available on-site.  

Until then, **every purchase—digital or physical—directly supports the move** to a space where music and technology will **take root in the wild**.

## 🛠️ Decentralized, Adaptive, Untamed  

Antsy Records isn’t about trends, algorithms, or **industry conformity**. It’s a **self-sustained, boundary-free soundscape**, thriving on:  
✅ **Seigr’s decentralized tech philosophy**  
✅ **A commitment to self-sufficiency**  
✅ **Music as an independent force**  
✅ **Art that is as resilient, adaptive, and decentralized as nature itself**  

**Support Antsy. Support Seigr. Be part of something untamed.**
